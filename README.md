3. Characteristics of the Most Loyal Customers
The most loyal customers were defined based on their total sales contribution and the number of transactions. We identified several key characteristics:
LIFESTAGE: The majority of loyal customers belong to the Older Families life stage.
PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: While some loyal customers are in the Premium category, a substantial number belong to Mainstream and Budget segments.

4. Hypothesis: Why Do Loyal Customers Like Certain Products?
Older Families may prefer products that offer value, quality, and convenience. This explains why products like chips and snacks are most profitableâ€”they provide quick, easy-to-serve, and enjoyable options for families.
Loyal customers in the Budget and Mainstream categories often make frequent, smaller purchases, contributing to sustained profitability.

This analysis provides insights into the most profitable products and the key segments of loyal customers.
